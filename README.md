# The Research
# Project Management

# 1. Data-set
- Patients have multiple exercises
- Patients are stored in a group
- Phasisions took recordings of patients with muscle tearment 
- Reading the data
- Matlab
- Not enough data 
## enriching methods
- Combining exercises per patient
- Using 5 frames, changing offset

## Cleaning our data-set
- Filtering / Ordering
- Combining multiple exercises from one patient
- 5 rows implementation
- Splitting test / train (on patient level)
- Splitting exercises 

# 2. Visualisation
- Raw visualistion 2d/3d
- 2d Visualistion
- t-SNE
- Combining raw + converted

# 3. Converting data
- Five exercises
- Time issue
- 5 splits of the data
- More than 5 splits
- Combining exercises for patients
- Enriching methods

# 4. Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression
- SVM 
- Implementing in framework

# 5. Coding Framework
- Reading the data-set
- UML 
- Benefits 
- Multi-os support
- Multi-threading
- Memory management
- Configurations
- Configuration loader
- Datalogger
- Statistics
- Visualsing results (tabulate / )
- Configloader â€“ parsing model results (sorting results)

# 6. Scrum Tasks
- Taable here 

# 7. Neural Networks
- Creating an image from our data-set
- Adding a 4th layer
