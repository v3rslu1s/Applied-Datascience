# 1. Research
We are doing research for the LUMC in a collaboration with the Laboratory of Kinematics and Neuromechanics (LK&N). The LUMC has requested known patient for muscle torment for a special medical recording to the hospital. The patients are pre-selected by specialized physicians in different levels of torment. Every patient was seated into a special recording room where a physician attached multiple sensors from the Flock of Birds (FOB) recording system on bones of the patient. The patient did multiple types of exercises in most cases multiple times. 

This leaves us with a data-set of labeled patient recordings. The labels are created an put on the data by the LUMC physicians and based upon the type of exercise and the amount of torment in the muscles. 

Our research is about using machine learning techniques to classify feature patients based on the previous classification of the LUMC physicians. 


# 1.1 Previous groups 
The previous research group that took an interest in this subject has done allot of work to get us started quickly. [https://github.com/Lukelumia/Applied-Data-Science]. They mainly did research to determent what type of machine learning model would fit the dataset produced by the LUMC the best. They created a way to visualize the data and figure out what parts of the exercise are possibly leading to worse classification of the data. They also created an approach to increase the dataset. 

After reading their full reports the 19/20 project group had some doubts about certain assumptions the group made. Based on this information we contacted the LUMC for clarification. This led to the LUMC sharing more labels on our dataset in order to take the doubts / possible assumptions from the previous group away. 


# 1.2 Project Management
For our research we had to use SCRUMM. This approach is not commonly used for research projects. However in our project group it worked good. After a few weeks reading / understanding the work of the previous group we were able sub questions (issues) building up to a main question. Each issue was built upon multiple tasks that were shared over the project group. All of this was implemented in Azure Dev Ops.  


# 2. Data-set
Physicians requested patients back in 4 groups. 
Each patient is requested to do multiple exercises: 
| Short | Description
| --- | --- |
| AB[nr.] | Abduction |
| AF[nr.] | Anteflexion |
| RF[nr.] | Retroflexion |
| EH[nr.] | Endo/Exorotation coronal |
| EL[nr.] | Endo/Exorotation humerus |

Every recording was done with the FoB (Flock of Birds) system. 


This system uses sensors attached to the skin of a patient to record the exact location of a bone using electromagnetic fields. For each recording moment of a single sensor the FoB system stores a 3D matrix with the 3D position relative to the ‘black box’ that creates the electromagnetic fields. This 3D position is saved in plain text as a euler angle / rotation matrix.

- Patients have multiple exercises
- Patients are stored in a group
- Phasisions took recordings of patients with muscle tearment 
- Reading the data
- Not enough data 
- Mirrored thorax

## new data-set
- Matlab
    - raw + calibration
    - extracting to csv 
    - woo angle system changed to lumc standards 
    - No changes in rotating when a sensor is switched
- Exercise groups are known
- Combining exercises based on labels instead of assumptions

## enriching methods
- Combining exercises per patient
- Using 5 frames, changing offset

## Cleaning our data-set
- Filtering / Ordering
- Combining multiple exercises from one patient
- 5 rows implementation
- Splitting test / train (on patient level)
- Splitting exercises 

# 3. Visualisation
- Raw visualistion 2d/3d
- 2d Visualistion
- t-SNE
- Combining raw + converted

# 4. Converting data
- Five exercises
