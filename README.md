# 1. Research
# 1.1 Previous groups 
- Problems with the data-set 
# 1.2 Project Management
- Creating scrum tasks

## domain knowlegde
- Used Language

- Questions LUMC 
    - What bodypart is the most important
    - Understanding the axis
    - What information can a physician get from the arm's extention
    - What information can a physician get from the smoothness of movement 
    - Left right
    - Man vrouw

# 2. Data-set
- Patients have multiple exercises
- Patients are stored in a group
- Phasisions took recordings of patients with muscle tearment 
- Reading the data
- Not enough data 
- Mirrored thorax

## new data-set
- Matlab
    - raw + calibration
    - extracting to csv 
    - woo angle system changed to lumc standards 
    - No changes in rotating when a sensor is switched
- Exercise groups are known
- Combining exercises based on labels instead of assumptions

## enriching methods
- Combining exercises per patient
- Using 5 frames, changing offset

## Cleaning our data-set
- Filtering / Ordering
- Combining multiple exercises from one patient
- 5 rows implementation
- Splitting test / train (on patient level)
- Splitting exercises 

# 3. Visualisation
- Raw visualistion 2d/3d
- 2d Visualistion
- t-SNE
- Combining raw + converted

# 4. Converting data
- Five exercises
- Time issue
- 5 splits of the data
- More than 5 splits
- Combining exercises for patients
- Enriching methods

# 5. Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression
- SVM 
- Implementing in framework

# 6. Coding Framework
- Reading the data-set
- UML 
- Benefits 
- Multi-os support
- Multi-threading
- Memory management
- Configurations
- Configuration loader
- Datalogger
- Statistics
- Visualsing results (tabulate / )
- Configloader â€“ parsing model results (sorting results)

# 7. Scrum Tasks
- Taable here 

# 8. Neural Networks
- Creating an image from our data-set
- Adding a 4th layer
- CNN 

# 9. Personal Development 
- Datacamp
- Lectures
- Udemy 


# 10. Presentations
